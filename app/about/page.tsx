            We are building a simple and powerful platform for AI-based image
            generation. Our goal is to make creative tools accessible, fast,
            and easy to use.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our website is focused on simplicity and clarity for our visitors, 
            and it’s in our best interest to make everything as easy as possible 
            for you. If you see something and think we decided to “cut corners,” 
            that’s not the case—we’re just making everything as clear as possible 
            so that no one has any questions. Our generator allows you to create 
            almost any image, including adult content, so feel free to use it 
            without worrying about confidentiality or censorship. We would be 
            very grateful if you consistently use our site and recommend it to 
            others. 
        
          </p>

          <p>
            The platform uses a transparent credit system, allowing users to
            generate images without subscriptions or hidden limitations.
          </p>

          <p>
            We continuously improve the product based on real user feedback
            and practical usage.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Thank you for everything!
