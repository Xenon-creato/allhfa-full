                This Refund Policy explains how refunds are handled for purchases made
                on this website.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our service provides access to digital goods in the form of credits
                that are used to generate AI-based images. Once credits are purchased
                and made available to the user account, the digital service is
                considered delivered.
            </p>

            <p>
                Due to the nature of digital services and instant delivery of credits,
                all purchases are generally non-refundable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Refunds may be considered only in exceptional cases, such as duplicate
                charges or technical errors that prevent the delivery of purchased
                credits. Any refund request must be submitted within a reasonable time
                after the purchase.
            </p>

            <p>
                All payment processing and refund handling are managed by our payment
                provider acting as Merchant of Record. Approved refunds, if any, will
                be issued through the original payment method.
            </p>

            <p>
                We reserve the right to deny refund requests that do not meet the
                criteria outlined above.
            </p>
