            This website provides an AI-powered digital image generation service.
            Users may purchase digital credits, which are consumed when generating

            exchanged or transferred.

            these Terms.

            Due to the nature of digital goods and instant delivery, all purchases
            are final. Refunds are generally not provided once credits have been
            delivered or used. However, refunds may be issued at our sole discretion
            in cases of technical failure or accidental duplicate charges.
